Keepboard is a free open source java clipboard manager that can save clipboard history
(either automatically or on-demand) and provides the ability to quickly search
and paste clipboard items copied in the past.

It supports text, image and file clipboard items and stores all data locally
(does not require any network access nor disk access apart from its snap-confined directory).
Keepboard has been tested on Linux (GNOME, KDE...), Mac OS and Windows platforms.

Note: It is a fork from https://sourceforge.net/projects/keepboard/!

To start: java -jar jar.jar
